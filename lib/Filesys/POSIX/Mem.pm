=head1 NAME

Filesys::POSIX::Mem - Filesystem whose logical structure resides solely in
program memory

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Filesys::POSIX::Mem> provides a filesystem whose structure and, to a large
extent, contents of regular files, exist solely in program memory as Perl data
structures and string buffers.  Regular file data up to a certain size can exist
entirely in memory; files exceeding that size are dumped to temporary files
backed by L<File::Temp>.

=head1 MOUNT OPTIONS

=over

=item C<bucket_dir>

Allows one to specify the directory in which temporary bucket files which back
regular file data are to be created and kept.

=item C<bucket_max>

Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of a regular file as it is kept in memory
before being flushed to a bucket file in disk.  The default value is, as per
L<Filesys::POSIX::Mem::Inode>, C<16384> bytes.
